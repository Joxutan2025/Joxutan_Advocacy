        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Renewable energy is derived from natural resources that are replenished at a rate that meets or exceeds their consumption. These resources include sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute significantly to environmental degradation, renewable energy sources are sustainable and have a much lower environmental impact.</p>

        <h2>Types of Renewable Energy</h2>
        <div class="types-grid">
            <div class="type">
                <img src="images/solar.jpg" alt="Solar Energy">
                <h3>Solar Energy</h3>
                <p>Solar energy is harnessed from the sun using photovoltaic cells or solar thermal collectors. It is one of the most abundant and accessible forms of renewable energy, capable of powering homes, businesses, and even large-scale power plants.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="type">
                <img src="images/wind.jpg" alt="Wind Energy">
                <h3>Wind Energy</h3>
                <p>Wind energy is generated by converting wind currents into electricity using wind turbines. Wind farms can be found onshore and offshore, providing a significant source of clean energy with minimal environmental impact.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="type">
                <img src="images/hydroelectric.jpg" alt="Hydroelectric Energy">
                <h3>Hydroelectric Energy</h3>
                <p>Hydroelectric energy is produced by harnessing the power of moving water, typically from rivers or dams. It is a reliable and efficient source of renewable energy, often used for large-scale electricity generation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="type">
                <img src="images/geothermal.jpg" alt="Geothermal Energy">
                <h3>Geothermal Energy</h3>
                <p>Geothermal energy is derived from the natural heat of the earth, often from hot springs or geysers. It can be used for heating, cooling, and electricity generation, providing a stable and sustainable energy source.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="type">
                <img src="images/bioenergy.jpg" alt="Bioenergy">
                <h3>Bioenergy</h3>
                <p>Bioenergy is produced from organic materials, such as plant and animal waste, which are burned or converted into biofuels. It offers a versatile and renewable energy source that can be used for electricity, heating, and transportation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="type">
                <img src="images/wave.jpg" alt="Wave Energy">
                <h3>Wave Energy</h3>
                <p>Wave energy is generated by capturing the energy of ocean waves and converting it into electricity. It has the potential to provide a consistent and powerful source of renewable energy, especially in coastal regions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="type">
                <img src="images/tidal.jpg" alt="Tidal Energy">
                <h3>Tidal Energy</h3>
                <p>Tidal energy is produced by harnessing the energy of tidal currents in the ocean. It is a predictable and reliable source of renewable energy, with the potential to contribute significantly to the global energy mix.</p>
